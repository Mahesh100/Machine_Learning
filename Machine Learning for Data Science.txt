 **Machine Learning with python**

- Machine learning is subset of artificial Intelligance.

-In machine leraning we models and engine and give it a lots and lots of data, our model would then find and leran patterns of input data so that it can identitify with certain level of accuracy.

-The more input data we give it  the more accurate our model is going to be.


# Application of Machine Learning 

- Machine learning have various application in :

-Self driving cars
-Robotics 
-Language Processing 
-Vision processing
-Forcasing stock market trends, wether


# Machine Learning in action :-

Machine learning project involves number of steps :

1] Step 1 : Import the data  (Often in form of CSV files)

2] Step 2 : Clean the data (Removing the duplicate data)(Varies from project to peoject)

3] Step 3 : Split the data into Training or test Sets

4] Step 4 : Create a Model (Includes selecting a an Algorthims)

5] Step 5 : Train the Model 

6] Step 6 : Make Preditions

7] Step 7 : Evalute and Improve 



# Libaries used in Machine Learning

1] Numpy :

2] Pandas : Used for data analysis. Pandas provides concept of data frame. Data frame is two dimensional  data structure similar to Excel spread sheet. In data frame we have rows and columns.

3] MatPlotLib : It is two dimensional plotting liberary which is used for creating graphs on plot.

4] Scikit-Learn : It provides common algorithms like decsion trees, neural network etc.

# Environment idel for Machine Learning :

-Jupyter

-To install jupyter we used platform called anaconda.


command prompt (Windows os)
 
 jupyter notebook

 http://localhost:8888/tree

 - The extension used for jupyter notebook is     .ipynb



# Step 1 : Importing Data Set [ In CSV file using jupyter]

Here we have downlaoded Data set from the :  www.kaggle.com  (Place for Data Science Projects)


Data set used from Kaggle : video game sale (One of the popular Data set in Kaggle)


1) Download Data set from kaggle
2) Move data set to default location of Jupyter 
3) import pands as pd


* Some useful shortcuts of jupyter

-Command mode and edit mode are the two mode of the jupyter cell (Press esc key to change)

- press H in users keyboard to see all the keyboard shortcuts of jupyter

** Build a Music Suggistation project


Step 1 : Downlaod the CSV file

Step 2 : Preapearing the Data (Clean the data)

Step 3 : Select an algorithm (Here we have use Decsion tree Algrithm)

Step 4 : Measure The Accuracy of the model

Step 5 :
